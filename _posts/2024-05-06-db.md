# Summary

# C++ Concepts

## Class

- C++ classes encapsulate data and associated functionality into an object
- Encapsulation

  - encloses data and functionality into a single unit (called a class)
  - Header file (interface)

    - includes declaration of all member variables and functions
    - starts with '#pragma once' which means it is compiled only once

## Stack Memory

- Higher addresses to lower addresses
- Variables live in stack memory in C++
  - the & operator retruns the momory address of a variable

## Pointers in C++

- A variable that holds the address of some object
- Useful to get the object's contents. you don't need to bring a whole object because it is wasteful, so just indicate the address to get the contents.
  - pass by reference instead pass by value (copy the contents)
