Usually the sliding window technique is used to solve problems finding consecutive elements (subarray or substring). From the image above, it has a fixed window size and slides the window to find the maximum sum of a size 2 subarray.


In the LeetCode problem [#209](#basic), I needed to find the length of the minimum size subarray sum which is equal or larger than the target number, so here the size of the subarray is not fixed.

Here is an example of the problem. The image shows how the window slides each step.
