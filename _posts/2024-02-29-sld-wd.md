*(Copied from [takeuforward.org](https://takeuforward.org/data-structure/sliding-window-technique/){:target="_blank"})*

Usually the sliding window technique is used to solve problems finding consecutive elements (subarray or substring). From the image above, it has a fixed window size and slides the window to find the maximum sum of a size 2 subarray.


In the LeetCode problem [#209](#basic), I needed to find the minimum size subarray sum which is equal or larger than the target number.
